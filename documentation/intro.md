# Introduction

Murali is a modern animation engine for mathematically precise, programmatic, GPU-accelerated animation. It uses deterministic timelines, a modern `wgpu` backend, and a type system that helps larger animation codebases stay easier to maintain as they grow.

Unlike traditional animation tools, Murali treats animations as deterministic functions of time. Every frame is derived from a well-defined timeline, making visuals predictable, reproducible, and easy to reason about. Murali is especially shaped for workflows where animation supports an existing narrative, such as audio narration or pre-edited video, where precise timing and clean synchronization matter.

Powered by `wgpu`, Murali runs natively across Vulkan, Metal, and DirectX, and provides first-class
support for LaTeX, Typst, and parametric geometry. This documentation covers the Rust authoring
surface from Murali `0.2.4`.

Murali is also being grown as an AI visualization engine for technical education. It already has AI
diagram components and experimental linear-algebra components, with probability, statistics,
calculus, optimization, information theory, data geometry, deep learning, LLM, and agentic-AI
surfaces planned through the end of 2030. See [AI Visualization](./ai-visualization/index.md) for the public
category roadmap.

## Why Murali?

Murali is designed around a few foundational choices:

* **Modern GPU backend** — built on `wgpu` (Vulkan / Metal / DX12), so Murali benefits from a modern cross-platform graphics stack instead of carrying that burden alone
* **Time-driven architecture** — animations are explicit functions of time, not frames
* **Rust type system** — enables safer, more maintainable large-scale animation code

The result is an engine that feels closer to **engineering a system** than scripting visuals.

## Why not Murali?

Murali is a new library, with its first release in April 2026. The APIs are still evolving, and many features are on the roadmap but not yet implemented.

Murali will evolve through real-world use. The author is building it in part for [Kavriq](https://kavriq.com), where it will be used extensively for technical visual storytelling, and that experience will strongly influence the direction of the library. If you have a specific use case in mind, please share it on [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/murali-engine/murali/discussions).

## Core concepts

Murali introduces a small set of composable primitives:

* **Tattva** — any object in a scene (shape, text, or composite). Derived from Sanskrit, meaning “element” or “essence.”
* **Scene** — a container for all tattvas and the global timeline
* **Frame** — the scene-owned landscape, portrait, or square composition area
* **Timeline** — defines how properties evolve over time
* **World space** — all coordinates exist in mathematical units, not pixels

These abstractions allow you to describe animations declaratively, while retaining full programmatic control.

## Installation

Murali is available on crates.io. For the full setup flow, see [Installation](./installation.md).

The published crate gives you the library surface. The reference examples live in the GitHub repository and are excluded from the crates.io package.

Add it to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
murali = "0.2.4"
anyhow = "1.0"
glam = "0.33"
```

**Requirements:**
- Rust toolchain (1.85 or later)
- A working graphics environment (for preview mode)
- `ffmpeg` (optional, for video export)

Quick start:

```bash
cargo new --bin my_scene
cd my_scene
mkdir -p examples
```

## What You'll Learn in 10 Minutes

By following the [Your First Scene](./first-scene.md) guide, you'll learn how to:

1. **Create a scene** and add visual objects (tattvas)
2. **Position objects** in 3D space using world coordinates
3. **Build a timeline** to schedule animations
4. **Animate properties** like position, scale, and opacity
5. **Run your scene** in preview mode or export it as video

The core workflow is simple:
```
Create Scene → Add Tattvas → Build Timeline → Play Timeline → Run App
```

## Your First Scene

Here's a minimal example that draws and undraws a circle:

```rust
use murali::colors::GREEN_E;
use murali::prelude::{ORIGIN, CAMERA_DEFAULT_POS};
use murali::{App};
use murali::engine::scene::Scene;
use murali::engine::timeline::Timeline;
use murali::frontend::animation::Ease;
use murali::frontend::collection::primitives::circle::Circle;

fn main() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
    // 1. Create a scene
    let mut scene = Scene::new();

    // 2. Add a circle tattva
    let circle_id = scene.add_tattva(
        Circle::new(1.5, 48, GREEN_E),
        ORIGIN,
    );

    // 3. Position the camera
    scene.camera_mut().position = CAMERA_DEFAULT_POS;

    // 4. Create a timeline with animations
    let mut timeline = Timeline::new();
    timeline
        .animate(circle_id)
        .at(1.0)
        .for_duration(1.5)
        .ease(Ease::OutCubic)
        .draw()
        .spawn();

    timeline
        .animate(circle_id)
        .at(4.0)
        .for_duration(1.0)
        .ease(Ease::InCubic)
        .undraw()
        .spawn();

    timeline.wait_until(5.5);

    // 5. Play the timeline
    scene.play(timeline)?;

    // 6. Run the app
    App::new()?.with_scene(scene).run_app()
}
```

### Running Your Scene

**Preview mode** (opens a window):
```bash
cargo run --example my_scene --release -- --preview
```

**Export mode** (creates video):
```bash
cargo run --example my_scene --release -- --export
// or
cargo run --example my_scene

// Without preview mode, scenes export to video by default
```

## Why timeline-based animation?

Murali is built around a timeline-based animation model for several key reasons:

1. **Determinism**
   Animations are defined as explicit functions of time, making their behavior predictable and reproducible.

2. **Precise temporal control**
   Elements can be scheduled with exact timing—ideal for synchronizing with audio, video, or pre-defined narratives.

3. **Deterministic seeking**
   Murali can reconstruct timeline-authored property and camera state at an absolute scene time from a captured baseline. Seeking fails explicitly when the requested interval crosses behavior that cannot be reconstructed safely, such as a one-shot callback, updater, or traced path.

4. **Composability**
   Animations combine naturally as independent functions of time, avoiding implicit state interactions.

## Why the name “Murali”?

The name *Murali* comes from the flute of Lord Krishna, which, in Hindu tradition, is said to produce music so pure that it touches the soul.

The goal of this project is similar: to make visual storytelling feel effortless, so that ideas flow clearly from storyteller to viewer. Murali aims to make mathematical expression not just precise, but deeply intuitive.
