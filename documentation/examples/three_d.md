# 3D

Murali's 3D support is built for explanatory video scenes, not for game-engine style simulation.
Use it when depth helps the viewer understand a shape, object, flow, or spatial relationship.

The current 3D workflow covers three main needs:

- authored mathematical geometry, such as curves, surfaces, axes, and wireframes
- static video props loaded from local `.glb` or `.gltf` files with `Prop3D`
- camera framing, movement, and perspective projection for making depth readable

All 3D objects are still ordinary Murali tattvas. Once an object is added to a scene, it can use the
same scene-level placement and timeline transforms as other elements:

```rust
use glam::{Vec3, vec3};
use murali::frontend::collection::primitives::prop3d::Prop3D;

let prop_id = scene.add_tattva(
    Prop3D::from_file("assets/props/apple.glb")?,
    vec3(0.0, 0.0, 0.0),
);

scene.set_scale(prop_id, Vec3::splat(0.8));

timeline
    .animate(prop_id)
    .at(1.0)
    .for_duration(1.2)
    .move_to(vec3(1.0, 0.4, 0.0))
    .spawn();
```

## What Exists Today

Murali currently supports:

- 3D positions through `Vec3`
- perspective and orthographic cameras
- 3D axes
- parametric 3D curves
- parametric surfaces
- wireframe and textured surfaces
- static `.glb` and `.gltf` props through `Prop3D`
- object movement, rotation, scaling, and opacity through existing timeline animations

`Prop3D` loads static glTF geometry, base-color material factors, and common base-color textures.
Prefer `.glb` when available because it travels as one file. Loose `.gltf` works when the referenced
`.bin` and texture files stay beside it. `Prop3D` is best for video props such as apples, balls,
books, animals, tools, robots, and other simple objects that support a scene.

## Current Boundaries

Murali does not currently try to be a full 3D engine. In particular, `Prop3D` does not yet support:

- skeletal animation
- physics or collision
- advanced PBR lighting
- engine-specific materials
- interactive object picking

Those boundaries are intentional. For Murali, the main question is whether a 3D object helps the
video explain something clearly.

## Making 3D Read Well

Depth is easy to add and easy to misuse. A good 3D scene usually needs at least one of these:

- a camera angle that separates front, side, and depth
- face colors, textures, or wireframes that reveal the form
- motion that shows the object from more than one angle
- surrounding axes, labels, or text that explain why the object matters

The bundled `demo-pyramid.glb` uses different colors on different faces because Murali's current
mesh renderer is mostly unlit. Real props with textures often read better, but faceted color is a
useful fallback for simple demo objects.

## Recommended Examples

- `curves_3d`
  Focus: one traced parametric curve and camera framing
- `surfaces_3d`
  Focus: a translucent shaded surface whose form is clarified by color and camera motion
- `wireframe_surfaces`
  Focus: wireframe curvature reading
- `textured_surface`
  Focus: UV texture mapping on a globe
- `prop3d_glb`
  Focus: loading a single-file `.glb` prop and animating it with ordinary scene transforms. The
  bundled demo asset is faceted so its 3D form remains visible before full lighting support exists.
- `prop3d_gltf`
  Focus: loading a loose `.gltf` apple prop with its sibling `.bin` file.
- `model_inspector`
  Focus: resolving, centering, framing, and continuously rotating an unfamiliar GLB/GLTF asset
  before it is used in a scene.

## Good First Pick

Start with `curves_3d` for the lightest 3D introduction, then move to `surfaces_3d`.

## What To Look For

- whether the camera helps the eye understand the shape
- whether the scene uses 3D because it adds clarity, not just because it can
- whether surface reveals are staged clearly enough to read

## Run Locally

```bash
cargo run --example curves_3d
```

For a static 3D prop loaded from a local GLB asset:

```bash
cargo run --example prop3d_glb
```

For a static 3D prop loaded from a loose glTF asset:

```bash
cargo run --example prop3d_gltf
```

To inspect either format with automatic framing and interactive camera controls:

```bash
cargo run --example model_inspector -- demo-apple
```
