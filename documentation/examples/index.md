# Examples

Murali's reference runnable examples live in the GitHub repository for Murali.

If you are new to Murali, read [First Scene](../first-scene.md), [Which API Should I Use?](../which-api-should-i-use.md), and [Animations](../animations.md) first. Then come back here when you want concrete scenes to run and modify.

## Running Examples

Clone the repository and run any example locally:

```bash
cargo run --example hello_shapes
```

The full catalog lives in the repository at [`examples/README.md`](https://github.com/murali-engine/murali/blob/v0.2.4/examples/README.md).

The published crate excludes `examples/**`, so these reference examples are available from the repository rather than from the crates.io package alone.

Some examples use experimental APIs. For example, the linear-algebra examples require the
`experimental` Cargo feature:

```bash
cargo run --features experimental --example linear_algebra_vectors
```

The repository helper scripts enable that feature automatically for examples tagged
`linear-algebra`.

## Collection Category Coverage

Every newly added `collection` category has at least one exported component and at least one runnable
example anchor:
