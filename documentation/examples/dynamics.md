# Dynamics

These examples are about continuous motion, evolving state, and updater-driven behavior.

## Recommended Examples

- `force_fields`
  Focus: moving charges and a field that updates in response
- `particles`
  Focus: dense procedural motion with cinematic framing
- `traced_paths`
  Focus: motion history becoming part of the visual result
- `neural_networks`
  Focus: routed signal playback over a structured diagram
- `transformer_attention`
  Focus: token relationships, attention heatmaps, and transformer-style structure
- `tensor_semantics`
  Focus: computed self-attention with named axes and stable element identity
- `tensor_operations`
  Focus: semantic reshape, split/merge, and broadcasting operations
- `tensor_slicing`
  Focus: explicit projection of rank-4 activations into a visual rank-2 view
- `self_attention_lesson`
  Focus: versioned trace ingestion followed by computed attention, residual, logits, and sampling stages
- `stepwise_storytelling`
  Focus: staged narrative flow rather than raw geometry alone

## Good First Pick

Start with `force_fields` for updater-driven motion. For AI computation, start with
`tensor_semantics`, then continue to `self_attention_lesson` for the complete trace-backed path.

## What To Look For

- whether the state evolution is understandable without narration
- whether the motion feels alive without becoming noisy
- whether the updater work supports the idea instead of distracting from it

## Run Locally

```bash
cargo run --example force_fields
cargo run --example tensor_semantics
cargo run --example self_attention_lesson
```
